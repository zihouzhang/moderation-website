        <h2>About This Site</h2>
        <p>Social media platforms are now central spaces for public discussion. Algorithms, however, quietly decide what information reaches users, raising new legal and ethical questions. At the heart of this project is one key issue: <strong>Are the content recommendation decisions made by private platforms subject to First Amendment scrutiny?</strong> This website explores that question through the lens of three stakeholders—tech companies, government regulators, and digital rights advocates. We aim to help the public understand how content moderation intersects with freedom of speech, data privacy, and democratic integrity.</p>

    <div class="section" id="tech">
        <h2>Stakeholder 1: Tech Companies’ Perspective</h2>
        <p>Tech platforms argue that algorithmic recommendations are protected as “editorial decisions,” similar to how newspapers choose what to publish. They say that as private entities, they have no obligation to show all viewpoints. They emphasize the need to filter out misinformation, hate speech, and harmful content. Companies like Meta and TikTok also point to the challenges of managing billions of posts daily. Over-regulation, they argue, risks chilling innovation and could force platforms to over-censor. Still, criticism continues—are they hiding behind editorial freedom to silence dissent?</p>

    <div class="section" id="government">
        <h2>Stakeholder 2: Government and Legal Experts</h2>
        <p>Policymakers and legal scholars argue that unchecked content filtering by private platforms creates a democratic problem. Some advocate for laws like the EU’s Digital Services Act to improve transparency. In the U.S., debates continue over how much the government can or should intervene. Court cases such as <em>Moody v. NetChoice</em> reveal the legal tug-of-war between free speech and regulatory oversight. Legislators struggle to strike a balance: prevent harmful speech, but avoid infringing on constitutional rights. The challenge lies in crafting policy that respects both innovation and democratic openness.</p>

        <h2>Stakeholder 3: Digital Rights Advocates and Users</h2>
        <p>Advocacy groups argue that algorithms silence vulnerable voices. Content moderation disproportionately affects minority users or political dissidents. They call for transparency reports, user appeals, and limits on data collection. Privacy is a major concern—cases like TikTok’s data breach highlight the risks of personal data being used to curate biased feeds. Advocates support independent audits of platform moderation, arguing that users should know why their content was removed or hidden. For them, the First Amendment must protect individual voices online, not just platform power.</p>
